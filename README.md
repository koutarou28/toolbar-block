# toolbar-block
Blocks Creative Toolbars In Minecraft 1.18.1 +
This plugin was developed in order to prevent creative toolbars from being abused in survival servers where players either have ops permissions or they are part of a multiverse aggregation in which multiple worlds reside on the same domain. 
What this plugin is not:
A. A workaround for setting player permissions per world. This plugin has a blanket effect and will target *any* player regardless of staff level when switching between gamemodes. 
B. A command logger to determine who was initiating gamemode commands as a method to investigate in-game abuses of power. 

What this plugin hopes to do: 
A1. Foster a fair and immersive environment in which players can rest assure there is no toolbar shenanigans happening on their favorite servers. 

Configuring the plugin:
This plugin is configured in the config.yml. It is possible to make edits in game, however results may vary. 
Player permissions can be edited in any permissions editor like LuckPerms or EssentialsX.
